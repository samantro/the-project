Nishika, there are so much things I want to write, yes im high but thats not the point,
so i got high with deepanshu and he is hidden gem, and surrised me today. So, let me begin,
we were high and sitting at the roof, the cold breeze was amazing, and deppanshu started talking
about the his school life, first about the coaching, the mindless thing that he did, this started reminding 
of my own piece of life, the school life, how we used to get punished by stick and how much I had about the school
nishika, I always has been that child in the school who always seemed sad, was quite, had crippling anxeity when 
talking to girls(which by the way has'nt gone anywhere), had 2-3 freinds, I didnt knew what made me sad? those degrading 
moments that I felt when I used to out of the class starting of each exams, when I had to down my face or hide it smiling?
or was it all the humiliation I felt when my father did something, when the people who gave him money have been fade up?
anyways deepanshu was talking about the school romance phase of our life, the era of seat rotations, and how that made him friends 
with akanksha, and then the facebook era, see, nishika, all love stories are not tragic, some are beautiful and happily ever after
type.
